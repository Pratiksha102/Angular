---------------------------Basic folder Structure--------------------------------------------------



Package.json 

functional attrributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies , run scripts and identify the 
entry point to our package

Node_modules
it is used to save all downloaded package from npm in your computer for the javascript project

src 

Components
code that can be reused

Assets
Images etc

Environments
More than 1 environment can be setup , configuration for different environments such dev , prod , qa

Index.html
This is the first file that is loaded in the project, in angular inside body its written <app-root> </app-root>

Main.Ts 
The process of loading the index.html page, app-level module and app-level component is called bootstrapping
or loading the app

Style.css
Css file

--------------------------------Advance folder Structure--------------------------------------------
package-lock.json 

It stores the detailed version of dependencies, for example jasmine is internally dependent on 4-5 other
packages

angular.json
Its the configuration file of the application , where we specify whcih file should be loaded when we first land on
the page, main.ts etc

tsconfig----> 3 types
tsconfig.json
basically angular uses typescript, so it has version like into which version of javascript it should be converted
eg ecma 2017. This is for global configuration

tsconfig.json
This is the configuration file on app level

tsconfig.spec.json
This is the configuration file for testing

browserlistrc
it tells about what all browser version does it support

karmaconfig.js
configuration of test files

polyfill.ts
if we are using old browser which angular does not support, and the output is not as expected, then import 
libraries in polyfill.ts, will get the expected output



-------------------------------Interview questions-----------------------

what if i delete package.json?
project wont run

diff b/w package.json and package-lock.json

overview of dependency vs detailed explanaton of dependency

package-lock.json delete?
can be generated again if use package-json
