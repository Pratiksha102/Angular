In jquery we  generally define variable, we use let var keyword to define variable ,and
even for function we use function getname.
but here everything is define inside classes so we dont need to use var let and other things , we can just 
directly write function name


In typescript you should always define the type when passing throigh function parameter, 
if we dont know the type then we can use any 

why its necessary todefine the type now and not in angular 10, 11 before
Its because now in file tsconfig.json , we have strict mode=true , earlier it was strict mode=false
